# Database

### Getting Started

There are two ways to create a new database instance:

#### MySQL

```java
Database db = new Database(
                "INSERT IP",
                3306,
                "INSERT USERNAME",
                "INSERT PASSWORD",
                "INSERT DATABASE NAME");
```

#### SQLite

```java
Database db = new Database(file);
```

The code will automatically make a JDBC connection URL for you. Connect to the database with:

```java
db.connect(); 
```

### Creating A Table

To choose what kind of data our columns are, create a new Column instance and add the following parameters. You can add these Column instances to an ArrayList in order to create multiple columns.

```java
List<Column> columns = new ArrayList<>();
        
        Column column = new Column(ColumnType.VARCHAR, "Test Column");

        columns.add(column);
```

Custom Lengths

**Custom Column Lengths**

```java
column.setLength(INSERT_LENGTH_HERE);
```

Disallow Null

To disallow null in a column, do this:

```java
column.setAllowNull(false); // (by default this is set to true)
```

**Current datatypes:**

```java
    VARCHAR,
    INT,
    DOUBLE,
    BOOLEAN,
    BIGINT,
    FLOAT,
    LONG,
    BYTE,
    DECIMAL,
    BLOB,
    TINYINT
```

#### Saving and Reading Java Objects

**Reading Objects**

Annotate the constructor in your object that you wish to use with `@DatabaseConstructor` For every parameter in your constructor, you'll need to add a `@Column (INSERT_COLUMN_NAME)` annotation.

```java
@DatabaseConstructor
public TestObject(@Column("profileName") String profileName) {
    // DO SOMETHING
}
```

`PLEASE NOTE: Both of these annotations are required. If they aren't included, the framework will throw an exception.`

Great! Now we are ready to actually start reading! Here's how:

```java
TestObject testObject = (TestObject) db.readObject("INSERT_TABLE", "INSERT_KEY", "INSERT_VALUE", TestObject.class);
```

**Saving Objects:**

```java
db.saveObject(testObject, "INSERT_TABLE");
```

#### Creating a table instance

```java
Table table = new Table(
                "fooTable",
                columns
        );
```

* Primary Key

If you wish to set a primary key, you can use this:

```java
 table.setPrimaryKey("INSERT PRIMARY KEY NAME HERE");
```

Great! Now, all there is left to do is tell the database to create this table. You can do that like this:

```java
db.createTable(table);
```

There you go! You should now have a table inside of your database.

### Transactions

Before we move on I want to leave an important note. Transactions are an essential part of working on a database and make sure you don't make any errors. Here's how to use them:

#### Starting a transaction

```java
db.startTransaction();
```

#### Committing a transaction

```java
 db.commit();
```

#### Rolling back a transaction

```java
db.rollback();
```

### Reading from the database

#### Reading from a database

```java
db.get("INSERT_TABLE_NAME_HERE", "INSERT_KEY_HERE", "INSERT_VALUE_HERE", "INSERT_COLUMN_NAME_HERE");
```

Here's a more detailed explanation of what these parameters mean:

```
For example, if you wanted to get the details about a player,
the key parameter would be "name" or whatever it is within your table
and the value parameter would be the player's name of whom you wish to get the details.

The "column" parameter would be the specific detail you'd like to get. For example,
if my table contained an "age" column, and I wanted to get the player's age,
I'd set the column parameter to "age"
```

### Inserting Into A Database

This is also pretty easy. All you have to do is make a HashMap of your keys, and values, like this:

```java
 HashMap<String, String> values = new HashMap<>();
        values.put("UUID", "epic uuid!");
        values.put("NAME", "SEAILZ");
```

Once you've done that, this is all you need to do:

```java
db.insert("INSERT_TABLE_NAME_HERE", values);
```

### Check if a table exists

Incredibly easy:

```java
db.tableExists("INSERT_TABLE_NAME_HERE");
```

### Deleting from the database

Also pretty easy:

```java
db.delete("INSERT_TABLE_NAME_HERE", "INSERT_KEY_HERE", "INSERT_VALUE_HERE");
```

### Checking if a row exists

```java
db.rowExists("INSERT_TABLE_HERE", "INSERT_KEY_HERE", "INSERT_VALUE_HERE");
```

### Sending your queries

There's a custom class called "Statement" which can be used to send statements to your database with ease. All you need to do is this:

```java
Statement s = new Statement("INSERT_MYSQL_QUERY_HERE", db.getConnection();
```

Now to execute the command, you have two options:

With Results SetThis should be used if the command is supposed to return some results. Here's his:

```java
ResultsSet r = s.executeWithResults();
```

Without Results Set\*\*! Should be used when the command is not expected to return results. For example, creating a new table.\*\*

```java
s.execute();
```

### Disconnecting

Once your are done interacting with your database, be sure to disconnect like this:

```java
db.disconnect();
```
